type is a function which identifies data types of variables
#12
with -> "" or str() function
#13
es movidzie - type casting or type conversion
#14
the operator that checks if two values are equal is ==
#15
ragaca = True and False
print(result)
it would print False. if there were two True values it would print True but not in this case
#16
True because both of the statements are correct
#17
it's if elif and else due to the fact that those are the only ones we've learnt so far that function based on certain conditions
#18
for loop can iterate over lists and strings
#19
while loop. as its name suggests it repeats a block of code WHILE a condition is true
#20
range() function primarily used in for loops is used to generate a certain set of numbers which can be iterated over
#21
if ??
#22
if something isn't valid for "if" we use "else" for these types of situations
#23
list is used to store information in the same way we use lists in real life
#25
since we start counting from zero in this instance
list = [2, 3, 4]
print(list[]) in square brackets we have to type 2 and it will print number four
#24
in ptyhon we start counting from zero, so we need to type 0 in square brackets if we want the first element of the list
#26
slicing allows us to slice a portion of a list or a string
#27
for example
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
sliced_list = [2:6]
print(sliced_list)
this would print numbers between 2 and 5 including number 5 itself
#28
there are three values that we use in slicing
the first is start, then stop, then step

start is the index of the first element

stop is the index of the first element to exclude

step is the interval between elements
#29
we create reusable blocks of codes with functions
#30
parameters
#31
we use upper() to convert a string to uppercase
#32
it's append
#33
the keyword is "def"
#34
we use "return" to return a value from a function

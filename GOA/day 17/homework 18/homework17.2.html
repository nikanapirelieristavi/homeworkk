            England </a>

            <p> England became inhabited more than 800,000 years ago, as the discovery of stone tools and footprints at Happisburgh in Norfolk have indicated. <br>
                The earliest evidence for early modern humans in Northwestern Europe, a jawbone discovered in Devon at Kents Cavern in 1927, was re-dated in 2011 to <br>
                between 41,000 and 44,000 years old. Continuous human habitation in England dates to around 13,000 years ago (see Creswellian), at the end of the Last <br>
                Glacial Period. The region has numerous remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age, such as Stonehenge and Avebury. In the Iron Age, <br>
                all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth was inhabited by the Celtic people known as the Britons, including some Belgic tribes <br>
                (e.g. the Atrebates, the Catuvellauni, the Trinovantes, etc.) in the south east. In AD 43 the Roman conquest of Britain began; <br>
                the Romans maintained control of their province of Britannia until the early 5th century.

            <h2>English Civil War</h2> </a>

            <p> The Wars of the Three Kingdoms, sometimes known as the British Civil Wars, were a series of intertwined conflicts fought between 1639 and 1653 <br>
                in the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, then separate entities united in a personal union under Charles I. <br>
                They include the 1639 to 1640 Bishops' Wars, the First and Second English Civil Wars, the Irish Confederate Wars, <br>
                the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and the Anglo-Scottish war (1650â€“1652). They resulted in victory for the Parliamentarian army, <br>
                the execution of Charles I, the abolition of monarchy, and founding of the Commonwealth of England, <br>
                a unitary state which controlled the British Isles until the Stuart Restoration in 1660.<br>
